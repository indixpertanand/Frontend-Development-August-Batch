        <h1>Politics in India</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            India, the world’s largest democracy, has a vibrant and diverse political landscape. Governed by a federal parliamentary system, India has multiple political parties representing a wide range of ideologies and interests. The country’s political framework is guided by the Constitution of India, which was adopted in 1950.
